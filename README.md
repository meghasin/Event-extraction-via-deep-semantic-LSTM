Proposed a novel approach using K-means clustering with Neural Network which showed improved accuracy and computational cost. This implementation was inspired from a comparative study performed to understand the effectiveness of decision tree, random forest and SVM with K-means for feature selection to detect spam.
See ProjectPresentation.pdf for the workflow.
